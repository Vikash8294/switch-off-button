- **Shutdown System:** Allows users to shut down the system instantly with a click of the button.
- **Restart System:** Provides the ability to restart the system with a simple button press.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** The application works on multiple platforms, including **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**.
- **Simple GUI:** Built with **Tkinter**, the application features an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical interface.

## ðŸš€ How to Use:
1. **Run the Application**:
   To start the application, open a terminal or command prompt and run the Python file:
   ```bash
   python SystemControl.py
   ```

2. **Use the Shutdown Button**:
   Click the **Shutdown** button to immediately shut down your system.

3. **Use the Restart Button**:
   Click the **Restart** button to restart your system.

   > **Note:** You may need to grant administrator or root permissions, especially on Linux/macOS, for the shutdown/restart commands to execute.

---

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used:
- **Tkinter:** Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **os:** Provides the functionality to interact with the operating system, allowing shutdown and restart operations.
- **platform:** Used to detect the operating system and execute the appropriate shutdown/restart commands based on the platform.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Additional Notes:
- This application uses `os.system()` to run shutdown or restart commands, so ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions, especially on Linux or macOS systems.
- The app is designed to work across different operating systems by checking the platform and issuing the corresponding shutdown or restart command.
- On **Linux/macOS**, the app may require `sudo` privileges to execute the shutdown/restart operations.
